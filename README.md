# TodoList

This todo list is an application where a user can view, add, update and delete their todos. It is the starting point for and exploration of Event Sourcing.

### To note: 
This is a learning project, with some comments left in for personal reference. 

This project was built without the use of TDD, for reasons of speed, and no testing has been done. This is not best practise but for the focus of this exercise is deemed acceptable. 


### TODO:
